# vive-report (Oculus Report Menu for SteamVR)
This basic mod lets you access the Oculus Report Menu on SteamVR. It does this using your right controller menu button,
so it should not have any issues with built-in Gorilla Tag keybinds.

## Flaws
- **Oculus users cannot use the mod.** The Oculus button is the right menu button on Rift and Quest, so the mod will not work for Quest / Rift users.
- **Some mod menus are able to detect Oculus Report**. It is not very popular, but some mod menus have the capability to do it.

## Installation
Look for the latest release, and download ``ViveReport.dll``. Drag this into your Plugins folder,
launch a game and press your right controller's menu button. The report menu should now show up and work as it would on a Quest.
